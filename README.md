## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed and ready:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or newer) – [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- A valid **[FNLB API Token](https://app.fnlb.net/account)** – required to authenticate with FNLB services
- *(Optional)* **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** – A fast JavaScript runtime that can be used as an alternative to Node.js

## 📦 Installation Steps

Follow these steps to get your FNLB cluster up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Download or clone the FNLB self-hosting project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fortnite-LobbyBot/Self-Hosted.git
cd Self-Hosted
```

> 💡 **Alternatively**, you can manually copy the files into a folder or download the source code as a ZIP.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install required packages with your preferred runtime:

- Using **Node.js**:

  ```bash

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your actual values:

```ini
API_TOKEN=your_token_here
CATEGORIES=12345678,98765432
NUMBER_OF_SHARDS=2
BOTS_PER_SHARD=32
RESTART_INTERVAL=3600
CLUSTER_NAME=Self Hosted Cluster
```

> 💡 **API Token:** Obtain this from your [FNLB Account](https://app.fnlb.net/account) under “API Tokens”.  
> 💡 **Category IDs:** Visit the [FNLB Bots Page](https://app.fnlb.net/bots), select a bot, and locate the **“Category ID”** in the **“About this bot”** section.

## ▶️ Running the FNLB Cluster

Once configured, start your FNLB instance:

- With **Node.js**:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- With **Bun**:

  ```bash
  bun start:bun
  ```

The cluster will initialize using your configuration and automatically restart on the interval you defined, ensuring long-term stability and uptime.
